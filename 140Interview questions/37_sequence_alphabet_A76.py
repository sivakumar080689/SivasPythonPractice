#Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and
#prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.
#Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
#without,hello,bag,world
#Then, the output should be:
#bag,hello,without,world
input_sequence = input("Enter a comma-separated of words: ")
words = input_sequence.split(',')
sorted_words = sorted(words)

sorted_sequence = ','.join(sorted_words)

print(sorted_sequence)

#print(sorted_words)
#without,hello,bag,world
